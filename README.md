Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rexle25
Web Developer

I find programming very interesting because there are so many creative ways to do everything. I mostly do web development, but I also enjoy learning new programming languages (such as Rust) and technologies. When I'm not programming, I like to do other creative things (short films, drawing, etc.).

I also find Linux and free software very suitable for me because I have a lot of freedom and can implement almost any idea, no matter how absurd it is.

    ðŸš€  I'm currently working on Hiking Cucumber
    ðŸ§   I'm learning Rust
